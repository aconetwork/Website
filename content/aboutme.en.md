üëã Hello everyone.

I am dude that is from Slovenia and most people know me under the nickname ACO. As mostly tech content creator I am making  [tutorials](/tags/ "Click/tap me to open!"), sharing [tips and tricks](/tags/ "Click/tap me to open!"), live streaming and more. All my ![](/images/social-logos/YouTube.png) videos are in 3 languages (*english*, *slovenski* (*slovenian*) and *srpski* (*serbian*)) where each language has its own video or one video with included subtitles.

Because of health issues curently I make barely any content but because of recovery my health is slowly getting bether so I can do more and more including content for you. If you are interested about health issues [click here for more info](/filum-acm-en/ "Click/tap to open!").
