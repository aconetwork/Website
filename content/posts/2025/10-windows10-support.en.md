Windows 10 support coming to an end in 14.10.2025 so no more updates but you can enroll (from Windows Updates window) with the `Extended Security Updates (ESU)` program in few different ways. Easyest way is if you live in European Economic Area (EEA) like me you can enroll for the 1 year free security updates with valid Windows licence. Also to enroll you need to sign in to the Microsoft account inside Windows and after you are enrolled sign in to the Microsoft account at least once every 60 days. If Enroll lnow is not available, you can try fix it with the video tutorial bellow. 

I simply do not feel good enough to record the video so I am posting this.
