This guide is a bottom part dissasembly of gaming laptop Asus ROG G752VL, then cleanup and thermal paste replacement. Do this if you feel comftable doing this because it is not simple process and if you are not jut give someone to do it for you. I suggest doing this every 3 to 5 years where it depends of almount of usage and thermal paste quality how fast it will dry out. When you start the process, go slowly and carefully where it takes longer time but there is less posibility for the mistakes. Electronic has a ton of components with connectors, wires, ... and you can for example knock off some tiny component and laptop can stop working. **SO AGAIN** be carefull and good luck üòÅ.

## The process

1. On the table, put on some rubber mat or something so you do not scratch your laptop. Put the laptop on it upside down, remove all the screw rubber covers, unscrew & take out the screws.

2. Lift the middle rubber, unscrew the screw & take out under it and remove the plastic cover from top side.
3. Unscrew & take out the screws for 2,5" disk drive and take the drive out. Optionally you can unscrew screws on the NVMe heat sink plate and remove the plate.
4. Unscrew & take out remaining screws.
5. Turn arround the laptop, slowly unhook back plastic cover (hooked with plastic hooks) and disconnect speakers connector.
6. Pull out the DVD unit.
7. Unscrew & take out the screws under the DVD unit.
8. Turn arround and open the laptop to remove the keyboard with plastic cover (plastic hooks are holding the cover). **REMEMBER** to remove cover just enough to disconnect 3 ribbon cables connecting cover to the motherboard because if you are not carefull, you can damage something. When connectors are disconnected just remove the top cover.
9. Disconnect the battery connector **FIRST** because if for example you disconnect screen cable, you can create a short on screen or laptop motherboard that leads to possible damage and laptop not working propertly.
10. Disconnect rest of the connectors.
11. Unscrew & remove both fan screws and remove the fans.
12. Unscrew & remove motherboard screws.
13. Unscrew & remove screen hinge screws. Take off the screen.
14. Dedust laptop components to remove the dust. I use bubble making machine for tub and soft brushes. You can use portable deduster, air pressured cans but tire air compressor is not recomended because supposedly little bit water in the compressor and with air going out it takes slight watter with it.
15. On the laptop motherboard unscrew the screws on the CPU cooler in cross patern few turns at a time unltil all screws are unscrewed and now slowly remove the cooler.
16. Clean off the old thermal paste with paper towels and Q-tips optionally with Isopropyl Alcohol (IA). Instead of paper towels you can use some non static towel. IA is to soften old thermal paste for easyer cleanup.
17. If you have thermal pads on VRM chips and they are not soft but hard just replace them with the same thickness ones but soft like Gelid Extreme. In factory on VRMs they put thermal goop so if you have it just clean them and put thermal pads on the chips. To determine thermal pad thickness you can use calipers to measure height difference between VRM height and cooler standofs (check the video for visual representation).
18. Now put everything back together we did before but in reverse.
