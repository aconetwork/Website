In [#shorts video](#question-and-answer-videos "Click/tap to jump to section: Question and answer videos!") I asked what thing A and thing B is. Today's answer will provide you basic info but if you still want more info, check the [Resources](#resources "Click/tap to jump to section: Resources!").

## Thing A: WIRE

A wire is a single conductor that is tipically made of copper, aluminium or sometimes steel (not for electrical use) with or without the jacket/isolation. We know `solid` and `stranded` conductor type. Stranded conductor is more flexible handling less power and frequency than one solid conductor of the same cross-section diameter but both are comparable weight. Wire jackets/isolations are colored for easyer use and non-conductive. Longer the conductor is, higher is the resistance and also more power/signal loss.

- **Solid** wire has one single long stiff, bendable conductor strand.
- **Stranded** wire cointains multiple very thin strands of solid wires twisted or braided together into a single conductor. Conductor in wraped with the appropriate jacket/isolation keeping conductors form.

The world has multiple wire gauge standards and represented with numbers assigning diameter or cross-sectionall surface area of a counduit. Some wire gauge standards:

- **American Wire Gauge (AWG)** uses imperial mesurment system in inches.
- **Standard Wire Gauge (SWG)** uses metric mesurment system in mm.
- **IEC 60228** the `International Electrotechnical Commission`â€™s international standard on conductors of insulated cables uses metric wire size standard and it is used in most parts of the world. Among other things, it defines a set of standard wire cross-sectional surface area sizes in mm^2 like in my country Slovenia.

Weird thing is that when gauge number increases, diameter/area sizes decreases. Check the [Resources](#resources "Click/tap to jump to section Resources!") for more info and wire types.

## Thing B: CABLE

Cable contains two or more solid and/or stranded conductors covered with jacket/isolation where they are wraped or bonded together in some way. For example classical home electrical extension cord has 3 has hot wire for current, neutral wire to conclude hot wire loop and grounding wire but each wire isolation has it's own color. In my country Slovenia hot wire is brown, neutral is blue and ground is yellow with green stripe but colors are not the same everywhere.

Few cable types:

- **Twisted pair cable** has two wires wisted together where inside one cable you can find one to several twisted pairs and it is often used in telecomunication industries, computer network stations, theaters, etc.. 
- **Coaxial cable** has one solid metal conductor in the middle encased with dialectric isolation and surrounded with braided wire shield encased in a tough outer jacket. They can carry different signals like for cable television, networking, also connecting antenna with transmitter/reciver boards and more with low losses.
- **Multi-conductor cable** can have 2 to 60 conductors where each conductor is encased in jacket that can be solid and stranded. These cables are used to connect computer, audio system and other devices.
- **Fiber-optic cable** uses thin optical fibers instead of traditional metal conductors made from glass or plastic. They can carry more information and faster than metal counterparts but they can not transmit power and not very bendable.
- **Ribbon cable** has multiple conductors connected side-by-side with non-conductive isolation. Some of them are called zip-wire because the individual conductors can be seperated from the ribbon.
